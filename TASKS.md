## Notes

- Use `- [ ]` for incomplete tasks
- Use `- [x]` for completed tasks
- Move tasks between sections as needed
- Use B + number for bug tasks
- **Task Order**: In Done section, place newer tasks at the top, older tasks at the bottom
- **Authentic Behavior**: Focus on real render mode behavior, not artificial delays
- **Mobile Testing Strategy**: Desktop browser emulation for pre-deployment, actual device testing post-deployment
