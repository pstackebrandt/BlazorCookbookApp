                        This application started as a practical exercise while working through tutorials of "Blazor Web Development Cookbook" by Pawel Bazyluk. That's why I think most solutions are useful for people who have worked through the book.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I decided to publish my solutions as reference examples for future use and as training for publishing a Blazor app with Azure. I believe that the preparations for hosting help to understand a technology much better than local work.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        I will extend the content step by step while working through the book and add my own ideas. For solutions not related to the Cookbook, I prefer to use separate projects.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        My Blazor learning journey began with live workshops at the .NET Day Franken conference and the book "C# 12 and .NET 8" by Mark J. Price. This book and its successors provide an essential foundation for Blazor and ASP.NET Core. It emphasizes database integration.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        "Blazor Web Development Cookbook" by Pawel Bazyluk contains a systematic selection of solutions and detailed descriptions for selected topics. However, the book requires basic knowledge in Blazor development. It is a good lightweight supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Himschoot's comprehensive book on Full Stack Development with Blazor 8 (including supplements for 9) provides a systematic and comprehensive introduction. It also contains 20 pages on Azure deployment.

    <!-- Why Blazor -->

                    <h5 class="card-title">Why I Chose Blazor</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        I appreciate Blazor because it is a versatile framework that enables me to create websites as Single Page Applications (SPAs) and can be used in additional areas like cross-platform app development. One can render web pages on the server and in the client's browser, providing flexible deployment options.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        Blazor allows me to leverage and extend my existing C# and ASP.NET knowledge. At the same time, it requires and promotes foundational web development skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">
                        It often reminds me of React but uses a more stable and secure set of libraries.
