# Git Workflow for Deployment Preparation

> Build & deployment commands are maintained in
> `docs/deployment/Production-Build-Guide.md` – this file focuses on Git flow
> only.

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE** ✅ **COMPLETED**
Merge current work from `feature/overview-optimization` to dev and main, then create a new feature branch for deployment preparation work.

## 📋 **CURRENT SITUATION**
- **Current Branch**: `feature/deployment-preparation` ✅ **ACTIVE**
- **Status**: Star rating system completed, all tests passing (104/104)
- **Changes**: Successfully merged to dev and main
- **Next**: Proceed with deployment preparation tasks

## 🔄 **GIT COMMANDS SEQUENCE**

### **Step 1: Verify Current Status**
```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch

# Verify all changes are committed
git log --oneline -5
```

### **Step 2: Merge to Dev Branch**
```bash
# Switch to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Pull latest changes (if working with others)
git pull origin dev

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/overview-optimization

# Push updated dev branch
git push origin dev
```

### **Step 3: Merge to Main Branch**
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes (if working with others)
git pull origin main

# Merge dev branch to main
git merge dev

# Push updated main branch
git push origin main
```

### **Step 4: Create Deployment Preparation Branch**
```bash
# Create and switch to new feature branch from main
git checkout -b feature/deployment-preparation

# Push new branch to origin
git push -u origin feature/deployment-preparation

# Verify you're on the new branch
git branch
```

### **Step 5: Verification**
```bash
# Verify branch history
git log --oneline --graph -10

# Check remote branches
git branch -r

# Verify working directory is clean
git status
```

## 📝 **ALTERNATIVE: SINGLE COMMAND SEQUENCE**

If you prefer to run all commands in sequence:

```bash
# Complete Git workflow for deployment preparation
git status && \
git checkout dev && \
git pull origin dev && \
git merge feature/overview-optimization && \
git push origin dev && \
git checkout main && \
git pull origin main && \
git merge dev && \
git push origin main && \
git checkout -b feature/deployment-preparation && \
git push -u origin feature/deployment-preparation && \
echo "✅ Git workflow completed successfully!"
```

## 🔍 **VERIFICATION CHECKLIST**

After running the commands, verify:
- [ ] `dev` branch contains star rating system changes
- [ ] `main` branch contains star rating system changes  
- [ ] `feature/deployment-preparation` branch exists and is current
- [ ] All branches are pushed to origin
- [ ] Working directory is clean (`git status` shows no changes)
- [ ] New branch is tracking origin (`git branch -vv`)

## 📊 **EXPECTED BRANCH STATE**

After completion:
```
main                    ← Latest stable code with star rating system
├── dev                 ← Same as main
├── feature/overview-optimization  ← Can be deleted after merge
└── feature/deployment-preparation     ← New branch for deployment work (CURRENT)
```

## 🛡️ **SAFETY NOTES**

### **Before Starting**
- Ensure all work is committed (`git status` clean)
- Verify tests are passing (104/104 tests)
- Backup current work if uncertain

### **If Something Goes Wrong**
```bash
# If you need to abort a merge
git merge --abort

# If you need to reset to previous state
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# If you need to see what happened
git reflog
```

### **Branch Cleanup (After Successful Merge)**
```bash
# Optional: Delete the merged feature branch
git branch -d feature/overview-optimization

# Optional: Delete remote branch (if no longer needed)
git push origin --delete feature/overview-optimization
```

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS AFTER GIT WORKFLOW**

Once you're on `feature/deployment-preparation` branch:

1. **T14.5** - Implement Impress page (25-30 minutes)
2. **T14.1** - Update Home page content
3. **T14.2** - Update README.md
4. **T14.3** - Production configuration review
5. **T14.4** - Performance optimization
6. **Deploy** - Create production build and deploy to Azure

## ❓ **QUESTIONS TO CONFIRM**

1. **Branch Protection**: Are there any branch protection rules on `main` that might prevent direct pushes?

2. **Collaboration**: Are you working alone or with others? (affects pull strategy)

3. **Backup**: Would you like to create a backup branch before starting the merge process?

4. **Branch Naming**: Is `feature/deployment-preparation` the preferred name, or would you prefer something else?

---

## ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

The Git workflow has been executed successfully. The `feature/overview-optimization` branch has been merged to dev and main, and you are now on the `feature/deployment-preparation` branch ready for deployment tasks.

### **Next Steps:**
1. Delete the merged branch using the commands provided above
2. Proceed with deployment preparation tasks (T14.1 - T14.6)
