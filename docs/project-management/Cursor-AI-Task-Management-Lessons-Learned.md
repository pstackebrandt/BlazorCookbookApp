# Cursor AI Task Management Lessons Learned

## Overview
This document will capture lessons learned from using Cursor AI for project task management without external tools like GitHub Projects.

## Key Approach
- Used Cursor AI chat to create and manage planning files
- Minimal manual editing of task files
- Chat-controlled task management
- Created supporting files for complex features (temporary use)
- No dependency on external project management tools

## User's Experience Summary
"In this project I did not work with an external tool for project management (GitHub Projects). I used Cursor to create and manage planning files without fixing much myself on these files. I mostly used the chat to control the task management. Sometimes we created a supporting file for more complex features for temporary use. This is new for my work with Cursor AI. And it worked rather well."
