## Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Project Information
1. Review the project's README file
2. Identify the main technologies and frameworks used
3. Determine the project's primary purpose and target audience
4. Check if there's a live demo or deployment

### Step 2: Create Description
1. Write a concise title (max 80 characters)
2. Create a 2-3 sentence description (target: 150-200 characters) focusing on:
   - What the project does
   - Key technical features
   - Why it's useful or interesting
3. Avoid overly technical jargon unless targeting developers
4. **Text prominence:** Keep description as main focus - don't let technology lists overshadow the core message
5. **Optimization checklist:**
   - Remove redundant words and phrases
   - Use action verbs ("showcases", "demonstrates", "features")
   - Combine related concepts
   - Focus on visitor value, not implementation details

### Step 3: List Technologies
1. **Primary Technology:** The main framework/language
2. **Supporting Technologies:** 3-5 key tools (prioritize well-known ones)
3. **Include Company Attribution:** Add company names in parentheses
4. **Link to Official Sites:** Provide useful links for each technology

### Step 4: Review and Refine
1. Check description length against other projects
2. Ensure technical accuracy
3. Verify all links work correctly
4. Consider mobile display compatibility
