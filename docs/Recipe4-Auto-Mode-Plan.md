# Recipe4 Auto Mode Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create `/ch01r04a` to demonstrate `InteractiveAuto` render mode behavior, completing the render mode comparison trilogy.

## Auto Mode Behavior
`InteractiveAuto` provides adaptive rendering strategy:
- **First visit**: Operates as `InteractiveServer` (SignalR connection)
- **Background**: Downloads WebAssembly runtime and components
- **Subsequent visits**: Operates as `InteractiveWebAssembly` (client-side)

## Implementation Strategy

### Component Structure
```
BlazorCookbookApp/Components/Recipe4/
├── OfferAuto.razor          # New auto mode component
├── TicketAuto.razor         # Auto mode ticket component
└── Shared/
    └── RenderAction.cs      # Existing action tracking
```

### Key Features to Implement

#### 1. Visit Type Detection
- Track if this is first visit vs subsequent visit
- Detect WebAssembly availability
- Show current execution context (Server vs Client)

#### 2. Action History Enhancement
- **First Visit Actions**:
  - Component initialization
  - Server-side rendering
  - SignalR connection established
  - WebAssembly download initiated
  - Interactive features available (server-side)

- **Subsequent Visit Actions**:
  - Component initialization
  - WebAssembly runtime loaded
  - Client-side hydration
  - Interactive features available (client-side)

#### 3. Educational Displays
- **Render Mode Journey**: Show transition Server → Auto → Client
- **Download Progress**: Indicate WebAssembly download status
- **Performance Comparison**: First visit vs subsequent visit timing
- **Execution Context**: Clear indication of where code is running

#### 4. Time Tracking
- Time to first interactivity (server-side)
- WebAssembly download duration
- Client-side hydration time
- Total time to full client capability

## URL Structure
- `/ch01r04` - Pure WebAssembly client
- `/ch01r04s` - Pure Server
- `/ch01r04a` - **Auto (adaptive)**
- `/ch01r04c` - Comparison page (future)

## Technical Considerations

### Render Mode Detection
```csharp
// Auto mode reports different names based on current execution
RendererInfo.Name // "Server" or "WebAssembly" depending on context
```

### State Persistence
- Action history should persist across server/client transitions
- Use browser storage for visit tracking
- Maintain component state during mode switches

### Performance Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (server rendering)
- Time to Interactive (SignalR connection)
- WebAssembly Load Time
- Client Hydration Duration

## Educational Value

### Comparison Matrix
| Aspect     | Client (`/ch01r04`)  | Server (`/ch01r04s`) | Auto (`/ch01r04a`)     |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| First Load | Slow (WASM download) | Fast (server render) | Fast (server)          |
| Subsequent | Fast (client-side)   | Network dependent    | Fast (client)          |
| Offline    | Full functionality   | No functionality     | Full after first visit |
| Bandwidth  | High initial         | Low ongoing          | Balanced               |

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding adaptive rendering strategies
- Performance trade-offs between render modes
- Real-world application of hybrid approaches
- Browser caching and WebAssembly optimization

## Implementation Priority
1. **T7.1**: Basic OfferAuto.razor component
2. **T7.2**: Visit type detection and tracking
3. **T7.3**: WebAssembly download progress
4. **T7.4**: Mode switching visualization
5. **T7.5**: Educational documentation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clear visualization of Server → Client transition
- [ ] Accurate timing measurements for both contexts
- [ ] Educational value for understanding Auto mode benefits
- [ ] Seamless integration with existing Recipe Overview system
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design matching other components
